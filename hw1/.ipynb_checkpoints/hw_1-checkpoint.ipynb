Use a scatter plot where the x-axis is the *log(rank)*, and y-axis is *log(frequency)*.  You should get this information from `word_counts`; for example, you can take the individual word counts and sort them.  dict methods `.items()` and/or `values()` may be useful.  (Note that it doesn't really matter whether ranks start at 1 or 0 in terms of how the plot comes out.) You can check your results by comparing your plots to ones on Wikipedia; they should look qualitatively similar.\n",
